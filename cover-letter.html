												<h2><strong>Top Technical Interview Questions You Need To Be Ready For</strong></h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>Most hiring managers know that finding the best technology professionals
											takes more than just an assessment of technical qualifications. While you will
											certainly come across standard questions about your technical skills and
											knowledgge of project management systems, tech interviews are notoriously unpredictable,
										  leaving you feeling lost when it comes to preparing.</p>

											<p>However, there is no reason to panic! Ultimately, tech recruiters are interested in
											how you approach problems, and their questions are designed to suss out your thought process.
											To help debunk tech interviews, these hiring professionals supplied their key questions and
											some pointers for formulating answers - even to the questions nobody sees coming.</p>

											<h3>1. "What do you know about our company?"</h3>
											<p>Sounds obvious? Alan Hattman, Manager of Talent Acquisition at Peloton Technology,
											has a yikes-worthy story that proves that the importance of research cannot be stressed enough.
											While he was looking to hire a Director of Marketing, not one but two candidates thought they
											were interviewing for a different company with a similar name.</p>
											<p>"They thought we were a bike company," Hattman says. (Peloton Technology is a vehicle
											technology company. The interviewees had it confused with Peloton Cycle). "They even talked
											about how they used our product and everything. So those were automatic fails. Do your homework.
											Research the job and the company you are applying for."</p>
											<p>When it comes to reading up on a prospective employee, Jenna Kass, Recruiting Manager at
											Tableau Software, says she always appreciates when "candidates take the time to research our
											company from a business standpoint." Before you walk into the interview, find out who
											the company's competitors are and gather information about their audience or customers.</p>
											<p>The last step is to build on your research with your own expertise. ShipMonk CEO Jan Bednar asks
											candidates for feedback about his company's product - specifically for changes they would make.
											His ideal response "would not only explain what they would like changed but also <i>how</i> they would
											change it."</p>
											<h3>2. "What would you bring to our monthly bakeoff?"</h3>
											<p>"It may sound like a silly question," says Max Schleicher, Digital Marketing Manager at Insureon,
											but this question gives him insight into candidates that a resume simply cannot. It is a twist on the
										  curveball question - which usually shows an interviewee's logic skills. While he appreciates those
										  questions, Schleicher wants to see <b>creativity, social skills,</b> and <b>communication style.</b>
										  "Trust me," he says. "You can learn a lot about someone from their baking preferences."</p>
											<p>There is no wrong answer, whether it be a standard "brownies" or "double butterscotch
											blondies with almonds," he says. The critical tell is whether interviewees "buy in, whether they are excited,
											and how well they are going to fit into the culture we are working to create."</p>
											<p>This question has another purpose; Schleicher says that a question like this humanises him and
											the company because he wants to win over the applicant too. "We want to sell our culture and our sense
											of teamwork to the new candidates. We want to attract candidates that buy into that," he says.</p>
											<h3>3. "What is the most challenging/exciting project you have done in the past two years?"</h3>
											<p>Your work should lead the way in any interview and Lauren Thompson, Zillow's Communications Coordinator,
											says that in addition to technical specifications, Zillow's interviewers want to see "the innovation
											an interviewee comes out with from the project." The goal here? "To figure out what you are passionate
											about," she says. </p>
										  <p>You should start preparing for this question long before you send out resumes, and a safe bet is
											to dig into each of your projects as you go to focus on what parts you are passionate about, what motivates you,
											and what types of work you want to do in the future. Then, practice articulating that list, so if an interviewer
											asks you to explain a project from your portfolio, you'll have more to say than a simple list of specs.
											Your answer might sound like, "I love 8-bit gaming, so I developed a C++ emulator for Chip-8. It combined my interest
											in digital preservation with getting to dust off my Tetris and Pac-Man skills. I am looking forward to applying
											some of the C++ tricks I used to more projects in the future."</p>
											<h3>4. "What kind of tech projects do you work on in your spare time?"</h3>
											<p>If you have not already picked on it, passion goes a long way in tech!</p>
											<p>Kevin Hayen, CTO of Let's Be Chefs, considers self-directed creative work a critical piece of assessing entry-level applicants
											and veteran candidates alike. The way an interviewee answers this question shows Hayen "what in tech they are really passionate
											about or if they even are passionate about tech" in the first place. It does not matter what your hobby is. Talk it up with
											all the genuine enthusiasm you have. Like many of these questions, it is not the acual answer that interests Hayen.
											He says that this question also helps him to figure out "how the candidate might fit into a particular team and what
											'bonus' skills they might bring to the company" - things you did not even think to add to your resume but will make you a
											more well-rounded applicant.</p>
											<h3>5. "Tell me about the most difficult technical challenge you have encountered and how you resolved it."</h3>
											<p>Bryan Petro, COO of GetMyBoat, asks this question to make sure prospective employees can do more than check off a box
											when a problem is fixed. "We are not looking for people who can just churn through bugs," Bryan says, "but people
											who can understand the big picture as a part of a larger product team."</p>
											<p>So that you are not up all night before an interview, wracking your brain for every challenge you have ever faced,
										  try keeping a log of the times your skills were pushed to their limits and how you rose to the occasion as you work on projects.
											You do not need to write essays here - a few bullet points to jog your memory will suffice.</p>
											<h3>6. "What technologies could you not live without?"</h3>
											<p>Stephen Negron of LegalTech Consulting, Inc. wants to know what tech skills candidates bring to the table, of course.
											However, he has a different line of questioning - a list of "revealing questions" that tell him about the interviewee's life as
											a techie.</p>
											<p>He asks:
												<ul>
													<li>- Tell me about your computers at home. What is your internet speed?</li>
													<li>- What are your favourite gadgets? Apps?</li>
													<li>- What kind of phone do you own?</li>
													<li>- What are your tech pet peeves?</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p>"I really want to know if they practice what they preach, if they live the tech life, and if they have an
											understanding of the everyday tech frustrations," he says.</p>
											<p>This is a point that is easy to overlook amidst loftier talk of expertise, but if you are not consciously engaging
											with devices, apps, and websites, all the technical skills in the world will not bridge that gap toward emphathising with
											the end user when it comes to designing your own products.</p>
											<h3>7. "Tell me about a time you were asked to do something you have never done before. How did you react,
											and what did you learn?"</h3>
											<p>The key to working in tech is not knowing everything - that is not even possible for multi-decade vets of the industry.
											For Brendan Browne, VP of Talent Acquisition at LinkedIn, this question boils down to the number one soft skill needed at LinkedIn:
											<strong>adaptability.</strong></p>
											<p>"Soft skills like adaptability are hard thing to suss out but they are critical for someone to be successful here," Browne says.
											Projects change direction all the time, while departmental reorganisations and management shifts lead to priorities being rearranged.
										  "Your ability to deal with these scenarious will impact where you are best able to contribute at a company."</p>
										  <p>As far as the best way to show your adaptability in an interview setting, Browne says he is "looking for real answers, not the canned,
											stereotypical responses." Go with an experience from your career or personal life that shows how you have been able to <b>adapt, perservere, </b>
											and <b>manage change.</b></p>
											<h3>8. "How much does a first class one-way ticket from New York to Abu Dhabi cost on Etihad?"</h3>
											<p>ShipMonk CEO Jan Bednar does not really expect anyone to know the answer - it is the infamous curveball question.
											"Frankly," he says, "we would be a bit surprised if they did." Then why ask it?</p>
											<p>"Whether they guess $3,000 or $80,000 is functionally immaterial," Bednar says. Instead, it is all about the process.
											"What steps do they take to solve the question? Do they draw upon past experiences? Projections? General knowledge? These are the skills we want to see," Bednar says.</p>

											<p><h4>Having a set of tech skills is one thing, but communicating your ability to use them <i>practically, creatively</i> and <i>efficiently</i> is what will help you
											land the job. Multiple hiring professionals stated that surprise brain teaser questions are all about your <i>thought process</i>, not your answer. So if you find yourself
											face-to-face with one of these seemingly ludicrous interview questions, take a breath, do not get flummoxed, and talk the interviewer through your thinking. That is all they want to hear.</h4></p>
